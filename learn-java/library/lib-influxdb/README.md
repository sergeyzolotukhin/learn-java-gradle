#### InfluxDB v2.x

* An [organization] is a workspace for a group of users. 
* * All dashboards, tasks, buckets, members, etc., belong to an organization.

* A [bucket] is a named location    where time series data is stored

####

* A [Measurement] acts as a container for 
* * tags, 
* * fields,  
* * timestamps. 

* The [tagset] is a dictionary of key-value pairs to store metadata with a point.
* The [fieldset] is a set of typed scalar valuesâ€”the data being recorded by the point.

####

* A [series] is simply a shortcut for saying
* * measurement
* * tagset
* * retention policy

* A [point] has four components: 
* * a measurement, ?
* * a tagset, 
* * a fieldset, 
* * a timestamp

#### 

The serialization format for points is defined by the [line protocol] 



All points with the same retention policy, measurement, and tagset are members of the same series.

* A [retention policy] configures 
* * how long InfluxDB keeps points (duration), 
* * how many copies of those points are stored in the cluster (replication factor), 
* * and the time range covered by [shard groups] (shard group duration).

#### InfluxDB v1.x

* A [database] is a container for
* * users,
* * points
* * retention policies,

1.x had "databases" while 2.x instead has "buckets" and "organizations"

##### Questions

* write ahead log (WAL)
* TSM files, TSM file layout
* The TSM format is based heavily on log-structured merge-trees.
