Display Data Channel (DDC) is a bidirectional communications protocol
The DDC bus is based on the Inter Integrated Circuit (I2C) bus
    It consists of a serial clock or SCL,
    a serial data or SDA line
    and a ground connection.

The Consumer Electronics Control (CEC) is a bidirectional bus
    CEC contains a single wire
    and a ground that it shares with DDC and HEC.

A +5V power line is used to supply power to the DDC bus

Hot Plug Detection (HPD) and HDMI Ethernet Channel (HEC) Data+ share the same line.
    HPD allows a source to detect if any HDMI enabled device is connected or removed while in operation.
    HEC is used for Ethernet compatible data networking between devices.
